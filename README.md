## Motivation Behind This Work
The motivation behind the work described in the abstract is to address the challenge of 
speckle noise in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and develop an effective image de-speckling strategy. 
SAR images are inherently affected by speckle noise, which arises due to 
the constructive and destructive addition of backscattered electromagnetic waves during the 
image formation process. This noise can significantly impact the quality and accuracy of the 
image interpretation and analysis.

The abstract highlights that automated interpretation of SAR images using machine learning 
and deep learning techniques has gained significant attention in recent years. However, these 
techniques often yield highly erroneous results when applied to images with speckle noise. 
Therefore, there is a need for an effective de-speckling technique to remove the noise and 
improve the quality of SAR images.

In this work, we have proposed a Fuzzy Logic (FL) based adaptive weighted image de-speckling strategy. 
The strategy utilizes a set of 125 novel Fuzzy Inference (FI) Rules to 
determine the relative similarities of a pixel's scattering properties with its neighbouring
pixels. Based on these similarities, an adaptive weight assignment is performed to remove 
speckle noise while preserving edges in the image.

Overall, the motivation behind this work is to contribute to the field of computer vision, 
specifically in the context of SAR image analysis, by developing an improved de-speckling 
strategy that can enhance the accuracy and quality of automated interpretation and analysis of 
SAR images.

## Introduction
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a powerful tool for remote sensing, providing images of 
the Earth's surface with high spatial resolution. However, SAR images are often corrupted by 
speckle noise, which is caused by the random interference of backscattered electromagnetic 
waves. Speckle noise can significantly degrade the quality of SAR images, making them 
difficult to interpret.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning and deep learning 
techniques to remove speckle noise from SAR images. However, most of these techniques 
are designed for specific types of SAR images and may not be effective for other types of 
images.

In this project, we propose a novel fuzzy logic-based adaptive weighted image de-speckling 
strategy that is designed to be effective for a wide range of SAR images. 
The proposed strategy uses a set of fuzzy inference rules to assign adaptive weights to each pixel in an 
image, based on the relative similarities of its scattering properties with each of the pixels in 
its neighborhood. The adaptive weights are then used to filter the image, removing speckle 
noise while preserving edges.

**Abstractâ€”**
Automated interpretation of image data provided 
by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) using several machine 
learning and deep learning techniques have become an 
emerging research area in the computer vision field in recent 
years. But processing these images without performing speckle 
noise removal often leads to the production of highly erroneous 
results. These images are inherently subjected to speckle noise 
which are formed due to constructive and destructive addition 
of backscattered electromagnetic waves while mapping them 
into resolution cells of finite dimensions during image 
formation. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we have 
designed an adaptive weighted image despeckling strategy 
based on fuzzy logic (FL). The considered strategy allows to 
remove speckle noise from any pixel based on the relative 
similarities of its scattering properties with each pixel lying in 
its neighborhood. The despeckling of pixels lying within 
predefined neighborhood is conducted using a set of 125 new 
fuzzy inference (FI) rules designed for this purpose. The 
proposed FL based adaptive weight assignment strategy 
enhances the efficiency of the designed despeckling technique as 
it enables it to perform effective speckle noise removal as well as 
preservation of edges. The effectiveness of this filtering strategy 
over existing well-known de-speckling filters is demonstrated in 
the Results section using quantitative parameters like Peak 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index 
Measure (SSIM) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI).
